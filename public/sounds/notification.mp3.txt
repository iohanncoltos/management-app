NOTE: A notification sound file (notification.mp3) should be placed in this directory.

For testing, the application will work without a sound file, it will just fail silently.

To add a notification sound:
1. Download a free notification sound from https://mixkit.co/free-sound-effects/notification/
2. Rename it to "notification.mp3"
3. Place it in the public/sounds/ directory
4. Delete this .txt file

Recommended: "Notification Alert Bell" or "Positive Notification" sounds work well.
