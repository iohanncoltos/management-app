# ✅ Your Custom Sound is Integrated!

## 🎵 What I Did

Your downloaded sound file has been successfully integrated:

**Original file:** `~/Downloads/mixkit-correct-answer-tone-2870.wav`
**Copied to:** `public/sounds/notification.wav`
**Size:** 338 KB
**Format:** WAV (high quality)

## 🔧 How It Works Now

The notification system will try to load sounds in this order:

1. **Your WAV file** (`/sounds/notification.wav`) ← **Will use this one!**
2. MP3 fallback (`/sounds/notification.mp3`)
3. Embedded beep (if both fail)

## 🧪 Testing Your Sound

### Method 1: Test Button (Quick Test)

1. **Start your app:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Open in browser:**
   ```
   http://localhost:3000
   ```

3. **Look for the "Test Sound" button** in the top-right corner (next to the bell icon)

4. **Click it!** You should hear your custom sound 🔊

5. **Check browser console** (F12) - You should see:
   ```
   ✓ Loaded notification sound: /sounds/notification.wav
   ```

### Method 2: Real Notification Test

1. Log in as **User A** (e.g., admin@example.com)
2. Go to **Tasks** or **Projects**
3. Create a new task
4. Assign it to **another user** (User B)
5. Log out
6. Log in as **User B**
7. Wait ~30 seconds (polling interval)
8. You should:
   - See the bell icon with a badge **(1)**
   - **Hear your custom WAV sound!** 🔊
   - See the notification in the dropdown

## 🎚️ Adjusting Volume

If the sound is too loud or too quiet, edit the hook:

**File:** `src/hooks/use-notification-sound.ts`

**Line 29:** Change the volume (0.0 to 1.0):
```typescript
audio.volume = 0.5; // 50% volume (change this)
```

Examples:
- `0.3` = 30% (quieter)
- `0.5` = 50% (default)
- `0.7` = 70% (louder)
- `1.0` = 100% (max)

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Console says "Failed to load /sounds/notification.wav"

**Check:**
```bash
ls -lh public/sounds/notification.wav
```

Should show your WAV file (338KB).

### Sound doesn't play on first notification

**Why:** Browser autoplay policy blocks audio until user interacts with page.

**Fix:** Click the "Test Sound" button once after page loads.

### WAV file too large (slow loading)

**Current size:** 338 KB (acceptable)

**If you want smaller:** Convert to MP3:
```bash
# If you have ffmpeg installed
ffmpeg -i public/sounds/notification.wav -codec:a libmp3lame -b:a 128k public/sounds/notification-small.mp3
```

Then update the hook to use the MP3 instead.

## 📊 File Comparison

Your notification sounds folder now has:

```
public/sounds/
├── notification.wav  (338 KB) ← Your custom sound! ⭐
├── notification.mp3  (13 KB)  ← Fallback
└── README.md
```

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Test the sound** - Click the "Test Sound" button
2. **If it sounds good** - You're done! 🎉
3. **If you want different sound** - Download another and replace `notification.wav`
4. **Adjust volume** - Edit line 29 in the hook file

## 🚀 Production Ready

Your sound is ready for production! When deploying:

1. ✅ Sound file is in `public/sounds/` (will be served by Next.js)
2. ✅ Hook will load it automatically
3. ✅ Falls back gracefully if file missing
4. ⚠️ Remember to **remove the test button** before production:

**Edit:** `src/components/layout/topbar.tsx`

**Remove these lines:**
```typescript
import { NotificationSoundTest } from "./notification-sound-test";

// In the JSX:
<NotificationSoundTest />
```

## 🎵 Want to Try Different Sounds?

Just replace the file:

```bash
# Download a new sound
curl -L "URL_TO_NEW_SOUND" -o ~/Downloads/new-sound.wav

# Replace the current one
cp ~/Downloads/new-sound.wav public/sounds/notification.wav

# Restart dev server
npm run dev
```

---

## ✅ Summary

- ✅ Your WAV file is integrated
- ✅ Hook updated to prioritize your sound
- ✅ Test button available in topbar
- ✅ Falls back to MP3 if WAV fails
- ✅ Console logs show which sound loaded

**Test it now by clicking the "Test Sound" button!** 🔊

If you hear your custom sound, everything is working perfectly! 🎉
