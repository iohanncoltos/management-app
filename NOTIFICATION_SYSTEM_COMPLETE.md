# 🎉 Hybrid Task Notification System - COMPLETE!

## ✅ ALL PHASES IMPLEMENTED

### Phase 1: Database Schema ✅
- ✅ Created `TaskUpdateLog` table with migration
- ✅ Tracks all task progress/status changes
- ✅ Fields: taskId, updatedById, changeType, oldValue, newValue, milestone, notified, createdAt
- ✅ Proper indexes for performance

### Phase 2: Email Templates ✅
- ✅ `sendTaskProgressEmail()` - Milestone progress updates
- ✅ `sendTaskCompletedEmail()` - Task completion
- ✅ `sendTaskBlockedEmail()` - Task blocked
- ✅ `sendTaskCancelledEmail()` - Prepared for future
- ✅ `sendDailyDigestEmail()` - Beautiful daily summary
- ✅ All emails have HTML + plain text versions
- ✅ Professional styling with colors and CTAs

### Phase 3: Update Tracking & Immediate Notifications ✅
- ✅ Created `task-notification-service.ts`
- ✅ `logTaskUpdate()` tracks all changes
- ✅ Integrated into PATCH `/api/tasks/[taskId]`
- ✅ Immediate emails for:
  - Task completion (100%)
  - Task blocked
  - Progress milestones (25%, 50%, 75%, 100%)
- ✅ Smart filtering: Don't notify creators about their own updates

### Phase 4: Daily Digest ✅
- ✅ Created `task-digest-service.ts`
- ✅ `getDailyDigestData()` aggregates last 24 hours
- ✅ Groups by task creator
- ✅ Includes:
  - Progress updates (non-milestone)
  - All completed tasks
  - All blocked tasks
  - Status changes
  - Tasks in progress (when no updates)
- ✅ Handles "no activity" case
- ✅ Beautiful HTML digest email template

### Phase 5: Cron Job ✅
- ✅ Created `/api/cron/daily-digest` endpoint
- ✅ Vercel cron configured in `vercel.json`
- ✅ Runs daily at 6 PM (18:00 UTC)
- ✅ Sends digests to all task creators
- ✅ Marks updates as `notified = true`
- ✅ Protected with CRON_SECRET
- ✅ Comprehensive logging

## 🚀 How It Works

### Immediate Notifications (Real-time)
When User B updates a task created by User A:

1. **Progress reaches milestone** (25%, 50%, 75%, 100%)
   → User A gets email immediately ✅

2. **Task marked as COMPLETED**
   → User A gets email immediately ✅

3. **Task marked as BLOCKED**
   → User A gets email immediately ✅

4. **All changes logged** to `TaskUpdateLog`

### Daily Digest (6 PM Daily)
Every day at 6 PM:

1. **Cron job runs** `/api/cron/daily-digest`

2. **Queries unnotified updates** from last 24 hours

3. **Groups by task creator**

4. **For each creator:**
   - If **has updates**: Send summary email with all changes
   - If **no updates**: Send "no activity" email with tasks in progress

5. **Marks all as notified**

6. **Logs results** for monitoring

## 🔐 Security

- ✅ Only task **creators** receive notifications
- ✅ Users **don't get notified** about their own updates
- ✅ Cron endpoint protected with **CRON_SECRET**
- ✅ Email addresses from authenticated **user table**
- ✅ All emails via secure **Resend API**

---

## ⚙️ Configuration

### Environment Variables Required
```env
# Email (already configured)
RESEND_API_KEY=your_key_here
RESEND_FROM_EMAIL=onboarding@resend.dev

# App URL (already configured)
APP_BASE_URL=https://management-app-jade.vercel.app

# Cron Security (ADD THIS)
CRON_SECRET=your_random_secret_here
```

### Vercel Cron Schedule
```json
{
  "crons": [
    {
      "path": "/api/cron/daily-digest",
      "schedule": "0 18 * * *"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Schedule**: `0 18 * * *` = Every day at 6 PM (18:00 UTC)

To change time:
- `0 17 * * *` = 5 PM
- `0 19 * * *` = 7 PM
- `0 9 * * *` = 9 AM

---

## 🧪 Testing

### Test Immediate Notifications (Available Now!)
1. **Create a task** (User A creates, assigns to User B)
2. **User B updates progress** to 25%
   - ✅ User A should receive email immediately
3. **User B updates progress** to 50%
   - ✅ User A should receive email immediately
4. **User B completes task** (100%)
   - ✅ User A should receive email immediately
5. **User B blocks task**
   - ✅ User A should receive email immediately

### Test Daily Digest (After Deploy)
1. **Throughout the day**: Multiple users update tasks
2. **At 6 PM**: Cron job automatically runs
3. **Check email**: Each task creator gets ONE digest email
4. **If no updates**: Creator gets "no activity" email

### Manual Test Digest Endpoint
```bash
# Locally (with proper CRON_SECRET)
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_CRON_SECRET" \
  http://localhost:3000/api/cron/daily-digest

# On Vercel
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_CRON_SECRET" \
  https://management-app-jade.vercel.app/api/cron/daily-digest
```
