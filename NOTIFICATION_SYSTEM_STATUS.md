# Task Notification System - Implementation Status

## ✅ COMPLETED (Phases 1-3)

### Phase 1: Database Schema ✅
- ✅ Created `TaskUpdateLog` table
- ✅ Tracks all task progress/status changes
- ✅ Fields: taskId, updatedById, changeType, oldValue, newValue, milestone, notified
- ✅ Migration created and applied

### Phase 2: Email Templates ✅
- ✅ `sendTaskProgressEmail()` - For progress updates at milestones
- ✅ `sendTaskCompletedEmail()` - When task reaches 100%
- ✅ `sendTaskBlockedEmail()` - When task marked as blocked
- ✅ `sendTaskCancelledEmail()` - Prepared (status doesn't exist yet)
- ✅ Beautiful HTML emails with styling and CTAs

### Phase 3: Update Tracking & Immediate Notifications ✅
- ✅ Created `task-notification-service.ts`
- ✅ `logTaskUpdate()` function tracks all changes
- ✅ Integrated into `/api/tasks/[taskId]` PATCH endpoint
- ✅ Sends immediate emails for:
  - Task completion (100%)
  - Task blocked
  - Progress milestones (25%, 50%, 75%, 100%)

## 🚧 REMAINING (Phases 4-5)

### Phase 4: Daily Digest
**Status**: NOT YET STARTED

**What needs to be built:**
1. **Daily digest generation service** (`/src/lib/services/task-digest-service.ts`)
   - Aggregate all unnotified updates from last 24 hours
   - Group by task creator
   - Generate beautiful summary email
   - Handle "no updates" case

2. **Digest email template**
   - Updates summary
   - Completed tasks
   - Blocked tasks
   - No activity message

3. **Cron job API endpoint** (`/src/app/api/cron/daily-digest/route.ts`)
   - Runs daily at 6 PM (configurable)
   - Calls digest service
   - Sends emails to all affected creators
   - Marks updates as `notified = true`

4. **Vercel Cron configuration** (`vercel.json`)
   ```json
   {
     "crons": [{
       "path": "/api/cron/daily-digest",
       "schedule": "0 18 * * *"
     }]
   }
   ```

### Phase 5: Polish & Features
**Status**: NOT YET STARTED

- User preferences for notification settings
- In-app notification bell
- Notification history page
- Email unsubscribe option

## 📊 Current Behavior

### Immediate Notifications (Working Now!)
When a user updates a task:
1. ✅ Change is logged to `TaskUpdateLog`
2. ✅ If milestone or critical status → Send email immediately
3. ✅ Task creator receives email notification
4. ✅ Marked as `notified = true`

### Daily Digest (Not Yet Built)
At 6 PM daily:
1. ❌ Query all `TaskUpdateLog` where `notified = false` from last 24h
2. ❌ Group by task creator
3. ❌ Generate summary email per creator
4. ❌ Send digest emails
5. ❌ Mark all included updates as `notified = true`
6. ❌ If no updates for a creator → Send "no activity" email

## 🎯 Next Steps

To complete the system, implement Phase 4:

1. Create `src/lib/services/task-digest-service.ts`
2. Create daily digest email template in `src/lib/mail.ts`
3. Create `/src/app/api/cron/daily-digest/route.ts`
4. Add `vercel.json` cron configuration
5. Test locally and on Vercel

**Estimated time**: 1-2 hours
**Priority**: High (core feature request)

## 🧪 Testing

### Test Immediate Notifications
1. Create a task (User A creates, assigns to User B)
2. User B updates progress to 25% → User A gets email ✅
3. User B updates progress to 50% → User A gets email ✅
4. User B completes task (100%) → User A gets email ✅
5. User B blocks task → User A gets email ✅

### Test Daily Digest (After Phase 4)
1. Multiple users update tasks throughout the day
2. At 6 PM, digest runs
3. Each task creator gets ONE email with all updates
4. If no updates, creator gets "no activity" email

## 📧 Email Examples

### Immediate: Progress Update
**Subject**: Task progress update: Fix login bug (50%)
**Body**: John Doe updated progress: 25% → 50% ⚡ Major milestone!

### Immediate: Task Completed
**Subject**: ✅ Task completed: Fix login bug
**Body**: Jane Smith marked task as completed 🎉

### Daily Digest (Future)
**Subject**: Daily Task Update Summary - October 3, 2025
**Body**:
- Progress Updates: 2 tasks
- Completed: 1 task
- Blocked: 0 tasks

## 🔐 Security & Privacy
- Only task creators receive notifications
- Users don't get notified about their own updates
- Email addresses from user table
- Secure email via Resend API

## ⚙️ Configuration
- Email service: Resend
- From: `RESEND_FROM_EMAIL` env variable
- App URL: `APP_BASE_URL` env variable
- Digest time: 6 PM (hardcoded, can be made configurable)
