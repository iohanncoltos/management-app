# 🔔 In-App Notification System

Complete real-time notification system with bell icon, sound alerts, and dropdown notifications.

## ✅ Features Implemented

- ✅ `NotificationType` enum (TASK_ASSIGNED, TASK_COMPLETED, PROGRESS_MILESTONE, TASK_BLOCKED, TASK_REASSIGNED)
- ✅ User preferences for notification settings (sound, email, desktop)
- ✅ Proper indexes for performance

### 2. **Backend Services**
- ✅ `notification-service.ts` - Core business logic
  - Create notifications
  - Get unread count
  - Get user notifications (paginated)
  - Mark as read (single/all)
  - Delete notifications
  - Helper functions for each notification type

### 3. **API Endpoints**
- ✅ `GET /api/notifications` - Get user notifications (paginated)

### 4. **Integration Points**
Notifications are automatically created for:
- ✅ Task assigned to user
- ✅ Task reassigned
- ✅ Task completed by assignee
- ✅ Progress milestone reached (25%, 50%, 75%, 100%)
- ✅ Task blocked

### 5. **Real-time with Polling**

- ✅ React Query for automatic cache invalidation
- ✅ Sound plays only once per new notification

### 6. **UI Components**
- ✅ `NotificationBell` - Bell icon with animated badge

- ✅ Integrated into topbar layout

### 7. **Sound System**

## 🎨 UI Features

- "Mark all as read" button
- Time ago format (e.g., "2 minutes ago")

## 🔊 Sound System

### How It Works
1. Hook initializes audio element on mount
2. Checks browser autoplay permissions
3. Plays sound when unread count increases
4. Only plays once per notification (prevents spam)

### Adding Your Own Sound
1. Download a notification sound (MP3 format)
2. Place it at `public/sounds/notification.mp3`
3. Sound will automatically play on new notifications

  taskTitle: "Fix login bug",

});
```

### Get Unread Count

```typescript
import { useUnreadCount } from "@/hooks/use-notifications";

function MyComponent() {
  const { data } = useUnreadCount();
  return <span>You have {data?.count} notifications</span>;
}
```

### Mark Notification as Read

```typescript
import { useMarkAsRead } from "@/hooks/use-notifications";

function MyComponent() {
  const markAsRead = useMarkAsRead();

  const handleClick = (notificationId: string) => {
    markAsRead.mutate(notificationId);
  };
}
```
